<h1>Obfuscate</h1>
<p>
    Some vampires can melt into the shadows, walk through a crowd unnoticed, or change their appearance. This is a form
    of illusion, and will not persist if the user draws attention to themselves, bumps into someone, or makes a great
    deal of noise. It also does not work on electronic surveillance such as cameras and microphones, but masters of this
    Discipline have been known to bypass even these limitations.

<strong>Type</strong>: Mental
<h2>Level 1</h2>
<h3>Cloak of Shadows</h3>
<p>
    <strong>Cost</strong>: Free
</p>
<p>
    So long as they stand perfectly still, the vampire remains completely invisible to the naked eye.
</p>
<h3>Silence of Death</h3>
<p>
    <strong>Cost</strong>: Free
</p>
<p>
    This power removes all sound from the vampire, silencing their footsteps, clothing, and so forth. A dropped object
    or slammed door would still make a noise, but sprinting footfalls or the racking slide of a shotgun would go
    entirely unnoticed.
</p>
<h2>Level 2</h2>
<h3>Unseen Passage</h3>
<p>
    <strong>Cost</strong>: 1 Rouse Check
</p>
<p>
    So long as they emit no overpowering odour and make no sound louder than a whisper, the vampire can move about
    without being seen.
