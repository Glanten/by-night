<h1>Blood Sorcery</h1>
<p>
    Employed almost exclusively by Clan Tremere, Blood Sorcery (or "<em>Thaumaturgy</em>" as they call it) is unlike
    other Disciplines in that it must be learned (normally from a mentor, but increasingly from books and other records)
    rather than evolved or adapted. Blood Sorcery employs genuine magic that no mortal could ever hope to wield.
    Learning this Discipline allows grants access to Rituals that, while lengthy and complicated, often prove extremely
    versatile.
</p>
<strong>Type</strong>: Sorcery
<h2>Level 1</h2>
<h3>Corrosive Vitae</h3>
<p>
    <strong>Cost</strong>: 1 Rouse Check
</p>
<p>
    Each Rouse Check allows the vampire to spill blood that corrodes 35cm<sup>3</sup> of material over 5 minutes. This
    does no damage to living (or supernatural) beings, and harder materials such as copper or cast iron might take
    longer to dissolve (alloys and steel often simply pit and scar).
</p>
<h3>A Taste for Blood</h3>
<p>
    <strong>Cost</strong>: Free
</p>
<p>
    By tasting a drop of blood, the vampire can determine a number of vital information about its owner such as their
    nature (e.g. mortal, vampire, ghoul, or other supernatural creature), Blood Potency, vampiric generation, and so
    forth.
</p>
<h2>Level 2</h2>
<h3>Extinguish Vitae</h3>
<p>
    <strong>Cost</strong>: Free
</p>
<p>
    With concentration and a gesture, the user can increase another vampire's Hunger by curdling the Blood within their
    body, effectively starving them from a distance.
</p>
<h3>Scour Secrets</h3>
<p>
    <strong>Cost</strong>: 1 Rouse Check
</p>
<p>
    Although it leaves a telltale bloodstain behind, the sorcerer can use their blood to search through written material
    to reveal information far quicker than they could by reading individual items.
