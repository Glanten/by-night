<h1>Thin-Blood Alchemy</h1>
<p>
    While not a Discipline in the strictest sense, Thin-Bloods have developed a unique method for both emulating more
    powerful vampiric abilities and developing unique powers of their own. Thin-Blood Alchemy is composed of formulae
    that must be prepared in advance, then consumed to take effect. The alchemist's Blood is always required, and most
    formulae also require mortal blood of a specific resonance.

<h2>Level 1</h2>
<h3>Far Reach</h3>
<p>
    <strong>Activation Cost</strong>: 1 Rouse Check
</p>
<p>
    The alchemist becomes capable of limited telekinesis, able to lift and manupilate objects (and, with effort, even
    people) at a distance. Causing direct harm with this power is difficult, but creative alchemists may boast about
    pulling safety pins, pumping brakes, and toppling heavy bookcases to deal with their enemies.
</p>
<h3>Haze</h3>
<p>
    <strong>Activation Cost</strong>: 1 Rouse Check
</p>
<p>
    This formula creates a mist that shrouds the alchemist, making them difficult to make out. The mist follows the user
    wherever they go and can be extended to cloud others nearby at an additional cost.
</p>
<h2>Level 2</h2>
<h3>Counterfiet (Level 1)</h3>
<p>
    At this level, an alchemist can develop formulae to reproduce the powers of level 1 Discipline. Each formula takes a
    week to research.
</p>
<h3>Envelop</h3>
<p>
    <strong>Activation Cost</strong>: 1 Rouse Check
</p>
<p>
    The alchemist can release a cloud of fog that clings to a target, blinding and choking them. This power only affects
    a single target, and the alchemist may only affect one victim at a time.
