<h1>Presence</h1>
<p>
    Presence targets emotions, not thoughts, so victims remain cognisant (unlike the victims of Dominate) but their
    behaviour is not always predictable. Dice modifiers from Presence powers do not stack. Masters of Presence can
    convey their enchanting auras through broadcast media such as radio or television, compel distant mortals to rush to
    their side, or instil terror with a single glance.

<strong>Type</strong>: Mental
<h2>Level 1</h2>
<h3>Awe</h3>
<p>
    <strong>Cost</strong>: Free
</p>
<p>
    The vampire adds their Presence to Charisma-related rolls (Persuasion, Performance, etc.), stealing the limelight to
    subtly affect the reactions and opinions of those around them.
</p>
<h3>Daunt</h3>
<p>
    <strong>Cost</strong>: Free
</p>
<p>
    Almost the opposite of Awe, while this Discipline is active the vampire adds their Presence to Intimidation rolls
    and those who would attack the vampire must first overcome a subconscious sense of dread.

<h2>Level 2</h2>
<h3>Lingering Kiss</h3>
<p>
    <strong>Cost</strong>: Free
</p>
<p>
    When a vampire drinks someone's blood and employs this power, their victim obsesses over the sensation, suffering
    withdrawal if they cannot find the vampire on subsequent nights. This can lead to easy feeds, but can be insidiously
    dangerous if used on another vampire.
