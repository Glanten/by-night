<h1>Protean</h1>
<p>
    One of the most overt Disciplines, Protean allows a vampire to change their physical form. Masters of Protean can
    adopt the form of a wolf or a bat, safely entomb themselves in the earth, or turn their body into a cloud of
    ethereal mist. Clothes and suchlike are transformed with the vampire, but carried items are not, so most Protean
    users prefer to travel light.

<h3>Eyes of the Beast</h3>
<p>
    <strong>Cost</strong>: Free
</p>
<p>
    With an intimidating red gleam to their eyes, the vampire ignores all sight penalties imposed by darkness (natural
    or otherwise).

<h3>Weight of the Feather</h3>
<p>
    <strong>Cost</strong>: Free
</p>
<p>
    The vampire can reduce their effective mass and density so as to become almost weightless. This can be invaluable
    when plummetting great distances, avoiding pressure plates, or suffering a throw or collision.

<h3>Feral Weapons</h3>
<p>
    <strong>Cost</strong>: 1 Rouse Check
</p>

    With long claws or dagger-like fangs, the vampire inflicts more damage with unarmed attacks and Superficial Damage
    they inflict with unarmed attacks is not halved.
