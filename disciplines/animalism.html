<h1>Animalism</h1>
<p>
    This discipline confers power over animals, particularly creatures of the night. Those who master this power might
    surround themselves with swarms of bats, transfer their consciousness into the body of a cat or coyote, draw
    additional sustenance from the blood of animals, or manipulate the Beast within other vampires.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Type</strong>: Mental
</p>
<h2>Level 1</h2>
<h3>Bond Famulus</h3>
<p>
    <strong>Cost</strong>: Free once the Blood Bond is established
</p>
<p>
    This power allows a vampire to create a particularly strong Blood Bond with a single animal. The resulting famulus
    is fantastically loyal, and several other Animalism powers can be used on it without cost.
</p>
<h3>Sense the Beast</h3>
<p>
    <strong>Cost</strong>: Free
</p>
<p>
    The vampire can detect the Beast within others, their hostility, and sometimes even their specific nature or the
    resonance of their blood.
</p>
<h2>Level 2</h2>
<h3>Feral Whispers</h3>
<p>
    <strong>Cost</strong>: 1 Rouse Check per animal type (free when used on a famulus)
</p>
<p>
    The vampire can engage in two-way communication with animals and may summon animals to attend them from nearby.
