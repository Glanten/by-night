<h1>Dominate</h1>
<p>
    Making eye contact with some vampires is all it takes to fall completely under their thrall. The victim of a
    Dominate power becomes a mindless puppet for the duration of their domination, and so there are limits to what
    Dominate can achieve (i.e. victims cannot follow commands that rely on their memory or judgement). Nevertheless,
    masters of this power can alter memories, direct crowds, and overcome their victims' instincts of self-preservation.

<h3>Compel</h3>
<p>
    <strong>Cost</strong>: Free
</p>
<p>
    This power allows a vampire to issue a short, simple command (e.g.: "kneel", "turn around", "give me that"),
    typically something that can be accomplished in one turn, which the unprepared mortal mind has almost no chance to
    resist.

<p>
    Similar to Compel, but encompassing more complex commands that take longer to complete (e.g.: "follow that car",

    ability.
