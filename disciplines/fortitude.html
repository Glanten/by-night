<h1>Fortitude</h1>
<p>
    A vampire's undead body is more resilient than it was in life, but vampires that master Fortitude can shrug off
    shotgun blasts, walk through fires, and shield their minds from powers that would probe their thoughts.
</p>
<strong>Type</strong>: Physical
<h2>Level 1</h2>
<h3>Resilience</h3>
<p>
    <strong>Cost</strong>: Free
</p>
<p>
    The vampire adds their Fortitude to their Health, making them even harder to kill.
</p>
<h3>Unswayable Mind</h3>
<p>
    <strong>Cost</strong>: Free
</p>
<p>
    The vampire adds their Fortitude to their attempts to resist coercion, intimidation, subterfuge, and supernatural
    powers (e.g. Dominate or Presence) that would otherwise influence their mind.
</p>
<h2>Level 2</h2>
<h3>Toughness</h3>
<p>
    <strong>Cost</strong>: 1 Rouse Check
</p>
<p>
    When this power is active, the vampire reduces all incoming Superficial Damage by their Fortitude, although even
    this power has limits.
</p>
<h3>Enduring Beasts</h3>
<p>
    <strong>Amalgam</strong>: Requires Animalism 1
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Cost</strong>: Free (for a famulus), or 1 Rouse Check
</p>
<p>
    Animals affected by the vampire's Animalism powers gain Health equal to the vampire's Fortitude
</p>
<h3>Earth's Perseverance</h3>
<p>
    <strong>Cost</strong>: 1 Rouse Check
</p>
<p>
    While this power is active, the vampire cannot be moved from their spot on the ground unless they wish to. They can
    still be damaged, as can the floor they are standing on.
</p>
<h3>Invigorate Vitae</h3>
<p>
    <strong>Amalgam</strong>: Requires Auspex 1
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Cost</strong>: 1 Rouse Check
</p>
<p>
    If the vampire uses this power and feeds their blood to a wounded mortal, the mortal heals 3 levels of Aggravated
    Damage per Rouse Check, instead of the default 1.
