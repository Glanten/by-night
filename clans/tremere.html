    <h3>Bane: Deficient Blood</h3>
    <p>
        Tremere characters are unable to Blood Bond other vampires (although they can still be bound by those of other
        clans)</p>
    <p>
        A Tremere character can Blood Bond a mortal, but must give additional Vitae equal to their Bane Severity
    </p>

<div>
    <h3>Compulsion: Perfectionism</h3>
    <p>
        Until the end of the scene, or until rolling a critical win on a skill roll, the Tremere character suffers a -2
        penalty to all dice pools</p>
    <p>
        This penalty is reduced to -1 for actions that are a repetition of previous ones, and removed entirely on a
        second repetition
