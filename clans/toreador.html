<h1>Toreador</h1>
<div>
    <p>
        Supernaturally graceful and charming, the hedonistic kindred of Clan Toreador are commonly artists, performers,
        or beauties obsessed with expression and aesthetics
    </p>
    <h3>Disciplines</h3>
    <div class="clan_disciplines">
        <div class="discipline_glyph">
            <img src="images/disciplines/auspex.webp" />
            <div class="discipline_name">Auspex</div>

    <h3>Bane: Aesthetic Fixation</h3>
    <p>
        The Toreador character suffers a dice pool penalty to Discipline rolls equal to their Bane Severity when they
        are in surroundings they find less than beautiful
    </p>
</div>
<!-- <div>
    <h3>Compulsion: Obsession</h3>
    <p>
        The Toreador character becomes obsessed with a single thing (a person, piece of artwork, blood splatter, the
        moon) and, for the rest of the scene (or until the object of desire can no longer be perceived), suffers a -2
        dice pool penalty to any actions that take their attention away from it
    </p>
