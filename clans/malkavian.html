<div>
    <p>
        Malkavians often have the gift of deep insight, but are also are touched by madness that comes from seeing too
        much of the world at once, understanding too deeply, and feeling emotions too strong to bear

    <h3>Bane: Fractured Perspective</h3>
    <p>
        If a Malkavian character suffers a Bestial Failure or Compulsion, their mental derangement inflicts a penalty to
        one category of dice pools (<strong>Physical</strong>, <strong>Social</strong>, or <strong>Mental</strong>;
        chosen at character creation) equal to their Bane Severity for one scene
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>Compulsion: Delusion</h3>
    <p>
        For one scene, the Malkavian suffers -2 to dice pools involving Dexterity, Manipulation, Composure, Wits, and
        rolls to resist Terror Frenzy
