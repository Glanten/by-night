<h1>Ventrue</h1>
<div>
    <p>
        The Ventrue are considered the aristocrats of the vampire world, willing to endure storms for the sake of
        leading from the front

    <h3>Bane: Rarified Tastes</h3>
    <p>
        The Ventrue character has a specific type of mortal from whom they prefer to feed (natural redheads, people born
        in acertain city, vegans, celebrities, etc.)</p>
    <p>
        A Resolve + Awareness test can sense if a mortal fits the character's feeding preference
    </p>
    <p>
        Feeding from outside the character's preference will result in vomiting up the blood unless the Ventrue
        character spends Willpower equal to their Bane Severity
    </p>
</div>
<!-- <div>
    <h3>Compulsion: Arrogance</h3>
    <p>
        Until they force someone to obey a command (without the use of supernatural powers such as Dominate), the
        Ventrue character suffers a -2 dice pool penalty to actions directly related to leadership
    </p>
