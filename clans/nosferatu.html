    <p>

    <h3>Bane: Repulsiveness</h3>
    <p>
        Nosferatu characters must taken the Repulsive flaw and may never raise the rating of their Looks merit
    </p>
    <p>
        A Nosferatu character suffers a dice pool penalty equal to their Bane Severity when attempting to disguise
        themselves (including the use of Disciplines such as Mask of a Thousand Faces)
    </p>
    <p>
        Most Nosferatu are perceived as hideous or terrifying when witnessed by mortals
    </p>

    <h3>Compulsion: Cryptophilia</h3>
    <p>
        Until they learn a secret they deem to be useful, the Nosferatu character suffers a -2 dice pool penalty to all
        actions whilst not actively working toward gaining a secret
    </p>
    <p>
        Additionally, the Nosferatu character refuses to give up their own secrets except in strict trade for something
        greater
