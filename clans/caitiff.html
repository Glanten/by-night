<h1>Caitiff</h1>
<div>
    <p>
        Sometimes a vampire does not inherit the traits of their sire's clan; these individuals are marked as Caitiff
        and are often abandoned by their sire and treated like dross
    </p>
    <h3>Disciplines</h3>
    <p>
        Caitiff characters have access to all Disciplines at character creation, but they buy Disciplines for a flat
        cost when spending Experience.

    <h3>Bane: Outcast</h3>
    <p>
        The Caitiff character begins with the Suspect flaw and they may not purchase positive status during Character
        Creation
    </p>
    <p>
        The Storyteller may impose a -1 or -2 dice pool penalty to social tests among vampires who know the character is
        Caitiff
    </p>
    <p>
        For Caitiff characters, improving a Discipline costs Experience equal to 6&times; the Discipline's level
