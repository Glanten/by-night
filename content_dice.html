    <h1>Dice</h1>
    <p>
        All dice rolled should be ten-sided dice (d10)

        <h2>Success and Failure</h2>
        <p>
            A result of 1 to 5 on a dice is a <strong>failure</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            A result of 6 to 0 on a dice is a <strong>success</strong>
        </p>
        <h3>Dice Pools</h3>
        <p>
            Attributes, Skills, Disciplines, and other Traits are measured in dots • each of which represents one dice
            in a character's dice pool
        </p>
        <p>
            When asked to roll a pool of dice (e.g. "<em>roll Willpower</em>"), you roll as many dice as you have • in a
            Trait and count the number of successes
        </p>

                Above is a ••• dice pool - any dice that roll 6 or higher are successes
            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            Other checks are rolled as dice pooled from multiple Traits (e.g. "<em>roll Intelligence + Technology</em>")
            which means you roll as many dice as you have in both Traits combined
        </p>
        <h3>Criticals</h3>
        <p>
            When rolling a pool, every pair of 0s you roll is a <strong>Critical Success</strong> and counts as an
            additional 2 successes
        </p>
        <h3>Tests</h3>
        <p>
            A roll is usually made as a test against a difficulty set by the Storyteller, or as an opposed roll against
            another character's roll
        </p>
        <p>
            If you roll successes equal to or over the difficulty, or roll more successes than your opponent, you pass
            the test
        </p>
        <p>
            It may be important to pay attention to the number of successes you get on a roll, as some tests,
            Disciplines, etc. grow in effectiveness the greater the margin of successes rolled
        </p>

        <h2>Hunger Dice</h2>
    </section>
    <p>
        When your character suffers levels of Hunger, they exchange regular dice in their dice pool with <strong>Hunger
            Dice</strong> on a one-to-one basis
    </p>
    <figure>
        <div class="dice_pool">
            <img src="images/d10.svg" alt="a d10 dice" class="dice_normal" style="transform: rotate(-24deg);" />
            <img src="images/d10.svg" alt="a d10 dice" class="dice_normal" style="transform: rotate(12deg);" />
            <img src="images/d10.svg" alt="a hunger dice" class="dice_hunger" style="transform: rotate(-6deg);" />
        </div>
        <figcaption>
            Above is the ••• dice pool of a character with 1 Hunger - one of the regular dice has been swapped out for a
            Hunger Dice
        </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
        Hunger Dice do not replace dice rolled for Humanity, Rouse Checks, or Willpower
    </p>
    <p>
        Hunger Dice function as regular dice except in certain circumstances
    </p>
    <h3>Messy Critical</h3>
    <p>
        If a roll is a <strong>success</strong> and any Hunger Dice have rolled a <strong>0</strong>, the result is a
        <strong>Messy Critical</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        You pass the test, but your Hunger compels you to act in a rash, destructive, or otherwise disadvantageous
        manner lacking foresight, subtlety, or self-control
    </p>
    <h3>Bestial Failure</h3>
    <p>
        If a roll is a <strong>failure</strong> and any Hunger Dice have rolled a <strong>1</strong>, the result is a
        <strong>Bestial Failure</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        You fail the test, and there is an additional penalty, in the form of a Compulsion, due to the Hunger within you
