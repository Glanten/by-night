    <h1>Dice</h1>
    <p>
        All dice rolled should be ten-sided dice (d10)
    </p>
    <section>
        <h2>Dice Pools</h2>
        <p>
            When asked to roll (e.g. "<em>roll Willpower</em>"), you roll as many dice as you have dots (•) in the
            appropriate Trait
        </p>

                <img src="images/d10.svg" alt="a d10 dice" class="dice_normal" style="transform: rotate(-31deg);" />

        </figure>
        <p>
            Many checks are rolled as a pool of dice from a pair of Traits (e.g. "<em>roll Wits + Technology</em>")
            which means you roll the dice for both traits and total the result
        </p>
        <h3>Wins and Losses</h3>
        <p>
            A result of 6 to 10 on a dice is a <strong>win</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            A roll with no wins is known as a <strong>total failure</strong>
        </p>
        <h3>Criticals</h3>
        <p>
            When rolling a pool, every <em>pair</em> of 0s you roll is a <strong>critical win</strong> and counts as an
            <em>additional</em> 2 wins
        </p>
        <h2>Tests</h2>
        <p>
            A roll's <strong>Difficulty</strong> is set by the Storyteller (or by an opposing character's roll)
        </p>
        <p>
            If you roll enough wins to meet or beat the Difficulty, your character succeeds
        </p>
        <p>
            It may be important to pay attention to the number of wins by which you exceed the Difficulty of a roll;
            some tests, Disciplines, etc. grow in effectiveness according to a roll's <strong>margin of success</strong>
        </p>

        <h2>Hunger Dice</h2>
        <p>
            When your character suffers levels of Hunger, they exchange regular dice in their dice pool with
            <strong>Hunger Dice</strong> on a one-to-one basis
        </p>
        <figure>
            <div class="dice_pool">
                <img src="images/d10.svg" alt="a d10 dice" class="dice_normal" style="transform: rotate(-24deg);" />
                <img src="images/d10.svg" alt="a hunger dice" class="dice_hunger" style="transform: rotate(12deg);" />
                <img src="images/d10.svg" alt="a hunger dice" class="dice_hunger" style="transform: rotate(-6deg);" />
            </div>
            <figcaption>
                Above is a ••• dice pool of a character with 2 Hunger - two of the regular dice have been swapped out
                for Hunger Dice
            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            Hunger Dice do not replace dice rolled for Humanity, Rouse Checks, or Willpower
        </p>
        <p>
            Hunger Dice function as regular dice except in certain circumstances:
        </p>
        <h3>Messy Critical</h3>
        <p>
            If a roll is a <strong>critical success</strong> (i.e. the roll succeeds and included at least one critical
            win) and any Hunger Dice have rolled a <strong>10</strong>, the result is a <strong>Messy Critical</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Your character succeeds, but their Hunger compels them to act in a rash, destructive, selfish, or otherwise
            disadvantageous manner lacking foresight, subtlety, or self-control
        </p>
        <h3>Bestial Failure</h3>
        <p>
            If a roll is a <strong>failure</strong> and any Hunger Dice have rolled a <strong>1</strong>, the result is
            a <strong>Bestial Failure</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Your character fails and faces additional drawbacks in the form of a <strong>Compulsion</strong> due to
            their Hunger
        </p>

        <h2>Rouse Check</h2>
        <p>
            Roll a single d10: on a 6 or higher the vampire's Hunger remains unchanged; on a 5 or lower the vampire's
            Hunger increases by 1
        </p>
        <p>
            A vampire may not perform a Rouse Check at Hunger 5; if forced to do so, they must resist a Hunger Frenzy at
            Difficulty 4
