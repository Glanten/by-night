    <h1>Dice</h1>
    <p>
        All dice rolled should be ten-sided dice (d10)
    </p>
    <section>
        <h2>Dice Pools</h2>
        <p>
            When asked to roll (e.g. "<em>roll Willpower</em>"), you roll as many dice as you have dots (•) in the
            appropriate Trait
        </p>

                Above is a (•••) dice pool
            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            Many checks are rolled as a pool of dice from a pair of Traits (e.g. "<em>roll Wits + Technology</em>")
            which means you roll the dice for both traits and total the result
        </p>
        <h3>Wins and Losses</h3>
        <p>
            A result of 6 to 10 on a dice is a <strong>win</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            A roll with no wins is known as a <strong>Total Failure</strong>
        </p>
        <h3>Criticals</h3>
        <p>
            When rolling a pool, every <em>pair</em> of 0s you roll is a <strong>Critical</strong> and counts as an
            <em>additional</em> 2 wins
        </p>
        <h2>Tests</h2>
        <p>
            A roll's <strong>Difficulty</strong> is set by the Storyteller (or by an another character's opposed roll)
        </p>
        <p>
            If you roll enough wins to meet or beat the Difficulty (or roll more wins than your opponent), your
            character succeeds
        </p>
        <p>
            It may be important to pay attention to the number of wins by which you exceed the Difficulty of a roll;
            some tests, Disciplines, etc. grow in effectiveness according to a roll's margin of success
        </p>

        <h2>Hunger Dice</h2>
        <p>
            When your character suffers levels of Hunger, they exchange regular dice in their dice pool with
            <strong>Hunger Dice</strong> on a one-to-one basis
        </p>
        <figure>
            <div class="dice_pool">
                <img src="images/d10.svg" alt="a d10 dice" class="dice_normal" style="transform: rotate(-24deg);" />
                <img src="images/d10.svg" alt="a d10 dice" class="dice_normal" style="transform: rotate(12deg);" />
                <img src="images/d10.svg" alt="a hunger dice" class="dice_hunger" style="transform: rotate(-6deg);" />
            </div>
            <figcaption>
                Above is a ••• dice pool of a character with 1 Hunger - one of the regular dice has been swapped out for
                a Hunger Dice
            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            Hunger Dice do not replace dice rolled for Humanity, Rouse Checks, or Willpower
        </p>
        <p>
            Hunger Dice function as regular dice except in certain circumstances:
        </p>
        <h3>Messy Critical</h3>
        <p>
            If a roll is a <strong>success</strong> and any Hunger Dice have rolled a <strong>10</strong>, the result is
            a <strong>Messy Critical</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Your character succeeds, but their Hunger compels them to act in a rash, destructive, or otherwise
            disadvantageous manner lacking foresight, subtlety, or self-control
        </p>
        <h3>Bestial Failure</h3>
        <p>
            If a roll is a <strong>failure</strong> and any Hunger Dice have rolled a <strong>1</strong>, the result is
            a <strong>Bestial Failure</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Your character fails and faces additional drawbacks in the form of a Compulsion due to their Hunger
