        <h2>Success and Failure</h2>
        <p>
            A result of 1 to 5 on a dice is a <strong>failure</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            A result of 6 to 0 on a dice is a <strong>success</strong>
        </p>
        <h3>Dice Pools</h3>
        <p>
            Attributes, Skills, Disciplines, and other Traits are measured in dots • each of which represents one dice in a character's dice pool
        </p>
        <p>
            When asked to roll a pool of dice (e.g. "<em>roll Willpower</em>"), you roll as many dice as you have • in a Trait and count the number of successes
        </p>
        <p>
            Other checks are rolled as dice pooled from multiple Traits (e.g. "<em>roll Intelligence + Technology</em>") which means you roll as many dice as you have in both Traits combined
        </p>
        <h3>Criticals</h3>
        <p>
            When rolling a pool, every pair of 0s you roll is a <strong>Critical Success</strong> and counts as an additional 2 successes.
