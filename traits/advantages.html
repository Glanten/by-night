                    It only takes one taste of another's Vitae to Blood Bond you; the Storyteller may rule that you

                    bags);
                    none of these provide Resonances; Ventrue characters may not take this Merit

                    blood of

                    this
                    minimum Hunger rises with your Blood Potency as it would for humans
                </p>

                    spend

                balances
                a flaw; they do not count towards a character's maximum dots in Advantages during character creation or

                    <strong>Anarch Comrades</strong>:<br />
                    You may treat a specific Anarch coterie as a collective one-dot Anarch Mawla, so long as you stay in
                    their good graces; write this coterie on the <strong>Relationship Map</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Camarilla Contact</strong>:<br />
                    You have the equivalent of a one-dot Camarilla Mawla who treats you poorly and constantly demands
                    favours and information from you, promising membership in the Camarilla and a chance at becoming a
                    full
                    vampire if you perform admirably; write this contact on the <strong>Relationship Map</strong>
                </p>

                    <strong>Catenating Blood</strong>:<br />

                    Sunlight halves you Health tracker and removes your vampiric abilities
                    (including Disciplines and Health benefits), but does not otherwise harm you; you still need to
                    sleep
                    sooner or later, and may suffer Impariment or torpor if you halve an already-damaged Health tracker

                    <strong>Discipline Affinity</strong>:<br />

                    out-of-clan Discipline for purposes of spending XP on this Discipline; drinking blood with matching
                    Resonance does not reward you with extra dots in this Discipline
                </p>

                    and appear perfectly alive to everything except the most advanced medical inspections
                </p>

                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Vampiric Resilience</strong>:<br />

                    A Camarilla Sheriff "mercifully" branded you as a Thin-Blood so that

                    You cannot use Disciplines (including Thin-Blood Alchemy) unless you
                    slake at least 1 Hunger each week by drinking another (non-Thin-Blood) vampire's blood; if you lose

            <h3>Allies</h3>
            <div class="indented">
                <p>
                    Allies are mortals who help and support you - family, friends, or an organisation that owes you some
                    sort of loyalty. A given Ally can help you once per story and may ask for help in return. Include
                    your
                    Ally or Allies on the <strong>Relationship Map</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The cost of Allies is a combination of their effectiveness and reliability; the maximum cost of a
                    single
                    Ally (or group of Allies) is (••••••).
                </p>
                <h4>Ally Effectiveness</h4>
                <p>
                    • A weak mortal (no use in a violent situation)<br />
                    •• An average mortal or group of tight-knit weak mortals<br />
                    ••• A gifted mortal or dangerous group of average mortals<br />
                    •••• A deadly mortal, a gifted mortal with supernatural powers, or a well-armed group of gifted
                    mortals

                <h4>Ally Reliability</h4>
                <p>
                    • They are available roughly half the time you call upon them<br />
                    •• When you call upon them, they are available in 1d10 hours<br />
                    ••• When you call upon them, they appear as soon as possible

            <h3>Enemies</h3>
            <div class="indented">
                <p>
                    Enemies are the opposite of Allies - mortals who appear at least once per story to oppose you. Write
                    your Enemy or Enemies on the <strong>Relationship Map</strong>. Purchase Enemies as a Flaw with the
                    following guidelines:
                </p>
                <h4>Enemy Effectiveness</h4>
                <p>
                    (•) A gifted mortal or dangerous group of average mortals<br />
                    (••) A deadly mortal, a gifted mortal with supernatural powers, or a well-armed group of gifted
                    mortals
                </p>
            </div>

            <h3>Contacts</h3>
            <div class="indented">
                <p>
                    A Contact is a mortal with access to information or materials that would otherwise be difficult for
                    you
                    to acquire. Include your Contacts on the <strong>Relationship Map</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    • Can do or acquire something cheap or common (Resources 1) e.g. a drug dealer, gossip
                    columnist, or used car salesman<br />
                    •• Can do or acquire something useful (Resources 2) e.g. veterinarian, small-time gun
                    dealer, reporter<br />
                    ••• Can do or get something expensive or difficult (Resources 4) e.g. security systems
                    expert, homocide detective, underworld fixer
                </p>
            </div>

            <h3>Fame</h3>
            <div class="indented">
                <p>
                    You may use your Fame to improve Social tests (normally instead of another Trait) when
                    appropriate (<em>"don't you know I am?"</em>); this should make tests against your fans, tests for
                    hunting, and so forth, easier. Fame has its downsides, of course, so you may want to invest in a
                    disguise.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By default, Fame applies to mortals, but you might instead be famous among vampires. Rare
                    individuals
                    might be famous among mortals <em>and</em> vampires.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Fame normally counts as a Merit, but may be purchased as a Flaw by picking Infamy or Dark Secret.
                </p>
                <p>
                    ••••• National or global fame; a movie star, musical phenomenon, or former world leader
                </p>
                <p>
                    •••• Everyone who even vaguely cares about your field or social trends knows something about you
                </p>
                <p>
                    ••• Most of the country, at the very least, know your name
                </p>
                <p>
                    •• Local celebrity, known by most of the city
                </p>
                <p>
                    • A select subculture knows and admires you
                </p>
                <p>
                    (•) <strong>Flaw</strong>: You owe a lot of money to the wrong people, or have made yourself
                    generally
                    odious; alternatively, your spouse, lover, or a close family member has Infamy (••)
                </p>
                <p>
                    (••) <strong>Flaw</strong>: You are a Cleaver, are known for several breaches of the Masquerade,
                    have
                    been Blood Hunted out of another city, or have grievously offended this domain's ruler
                </p>
                <h4>Infamy</h4>
                <p>
                    Infamy is the Flaw version of Fame - you are well known for something horrible. At the very least,
                    Social tests and reactions suffer by the value of the Flaw; at worst authorities may attempt to kill
                    or
                    capture you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The one-dot version of Infamy also includes the equivalent of a one-dot Dark Secret.
                </p>
                <h4>Dark Secret</h4>
                <p>
                    This Flaw costs one dot less than the equivalent Infamy, as it is largely unknown.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h3>Influence</h3>
            <div class="indented">
                <p>
                    Whether through wealth, prestige, political office, blackmail, or supernatural influence, you have
                    pull
                    with the local mortal community. Influence applies most within one group or region of a city (e.g.
                    organised crime, the media, the police, the church, the South Side, Manhattan Island).
                </p>
                <p>
                    You may use your Influence in place of another trait for relevant tests.
                </p>

                    <strong>Merit: Dominant</strong> •••••<br />

                    <strong>Merit: Powerful</strong> ••••<br />

                    <strong>Merit: Entrenched</strong> •••<br />
                    Mortal factions and power-brokers hesitate to oppose you
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Merit: Influential</strong> ••<br />
                    People want to do you favours
                </p>

                    <strong>Flaw: Disliked</strong> (•)<br />
                    -1 to Social tests involving any group in the city except your Allies, Contacts, and other
                    explicitly
                    loyal supporters
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Flaw: Despised</strong> (••)<br />
                    -2 to convince a neutral actor to politically support you or do you a favour; one group or region in
                    the
                    city always attempts to thwart you and your associates

            <h3>Haven</h3>
            <div class="indented">
                <p>
                    Without an appropriate Background such as Influence, Resources, or Status, a character's default
                    Haven
                    is likely to be something like a room in an abandoned motel, a rented office space, a single
                    self-storage unit, or a small apartment with blacked-out windows.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Points in Haven abstractly represent its size, security, and privacy; this increases the Difficulty
                    third parties have finding, surveilling, or penetrating a Haven, and makes it easier for the
                    resident
                    vampire to notice danger whilst present.

                <p>
                    <strong>Merit: Modest Haven</strong> •<br />

                    Each dot in this Merit adds a stand of arms: one pistol and
                    one long firearm, with ammunition for both; their concealment and security is based on your Haven's

                    control - it may be a ghost, cursed object, or dimensional portal; it provides at least a -1 penalty

            <h3>Mask</h3>
            <div class="indented">
                <p>
                    A Mask is a vampire's human identity; by default characters have no need for a Mask or have a very
                    basic
                    one (e.g. a fake name and ID that will stand up to a routine traffic stop), but this identity will
                    not
                    stand up to a proper background check or investigation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Merit: Excellent Mask</strong> ••<br />
                    Your Mask can withstand probing from the national police
                    (FBI, Scotland Yard, etc.); you may also purchase the Zeroed and Cobbler Merits
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Merit: Good Mask</strong> •<br />
                    Your Mask can withstand provincial or state-level checking and
                    includes a birth certificate, bank account, credit history, etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Merit: Zeroed</strong> •<br />
                    Someone has purged your records; you do not officially exist
                    (this Merit requires a two-dot Mask)
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Merit: Cobbler</strong> •<br />
                    You can create or source Masks: creating a Mask takes 3 days per
                    dot (and may expose you online if you're unlucky), sourcing a Mask only takes 1 day per dot but
                    requires
                    something in return (this Merit requires a two-dot Mask)
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Flaw: Known Corpse</strong> (•)<br />
                    People know you died recently and will react with shock and/or
                    horror if they recognise you or look you up on a database
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Flaw: Known Blankbody</strong> (••)<br />
                    Your biometrics, name, history, known associates, and
                    aliases appear in several intelligence agency databases - those in the know will easily be able to
                    read
                    between the lines and identify you as a vampire

            <h3>Mawla</h3>
            <div class="indented">
                <p>
                    A fellow vampire, or small group of vampires (plural: Mawali, costs one more dot than a lone Mawla)
                    who
                    looks out for you, provides helpful advice, acts as a mentor, occasionally pushes or covers
                    politically
                    on your behalf, but expects reciprocation. Mawali do not fight your battles or call in favours on
                    your
                    behalf. Abusing a Mawla's helpfulness usually reduces dots in the Advantage.

                <p>
                    The dots in the Malwa Advantage measure the power of the Mawla, as below:

                <h4>Adversary</h4>
                <p>
                    The opposite of a Mawla is an Adversary: a vampire who wishes you (or more likely your sire,
                    lineage, or
                    mentor) harm; Adversaries range from a rankled (•) Elder or vengeful (••) Primogen to an angered
                    (•••)
                    Prince or cabal

                </p>

                    You must exert some sort of control over Retainers (e.g. salary, mesmerism, or a Blood Bond), and no
                    Retainer is unfailingly loyal or flawlessly skilled.

                    You have a standing and reputation (earned or otherwise) within a specific local vampire community
                    (usually the Anarchs, Camarilla, or Sabbat). Status in one city may apply in another, but at a
                    penalty.
                    You may use your Status to augment a Social dice pool, but overuse of it will draw negative
