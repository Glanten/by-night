                involving

            <h2>Thin-Blood Merits and Flaws</h2>
            <p>
                These merits and flaws are only for Thin-Blood characters; they do not have • values as each merit
                balances
                a flaw; they do not count towards a character's maximum dots in Advantages during character creation or
                when
                purchased by spending XP
            </p>
            <h3>Thin-Blood Merits</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Anarch Comrades</strong>: You may treat an Anarch coterie as a collective one-dot Anarch Mawla,
                so
                long as you stay in their good graces; write this coterie on the <strong>Relationship Map</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Camarilla Contact</strong>: You have the equivalent of a one-dot Camarilla Mawla who treats you
                poorly and constantly demands favours and information from you, promising membership in the Camarilla
                and a
                chance at becoming a full vampire if you perform admirably; write this contact on the
                <strong>Relationship
                    Map</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Catenating Blood</strong>: You can Blood Bond and Embrace as a normal vampire; vampires created
                this
                way will be Thin-Bloods
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Day Drinker</strong>: Sunlight halves you Health tracker and removes your vampiric abilities
                (including Disciplines and Health benefits), but does not otherwise harm you; you still need to sleep
                sooner
                or later, and may suffer Impariment or torpor if you halve an already-damaged Health tracker
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Discipline Affinity</strong>: Gain one dot in a Discipline of your choice - treat this as an
                out-of-clan Discipline for purposes of spending XP on this Discipline; drinking blood with matching
                Resonance does not reward you with extra dots in this Discipline
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Lifelike</strong>: You have a heartbeat, can eat and drink normally, engage in sexual
                activities,
                and appear perfectly alive to everything except the most advanced medical inspections
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Thin-Blood Alchemist</strong>: Gain one dot and one formula in Thin-Blood Alchemy; you may
                purchase
                more dots and formulae through XP as normal
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Vampiric Resilience</strong>: You treat slashing and puncture wounds as Superficial Damage as a
                regular vampire would
            </p>
            <h3>Thin-Blood Flaws</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Baby Teeth</strong>: You cannot bite in order to feed, you must cut your victims or extract
                their
                blood using equipment such as a syringe
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Bestial Temper</strong>: You test for Frenzy as a normal vampire
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Camarilla Brand</strong>: A Camarilla Sheriff "mercifully" branded you as a Thin-Blood so that
                all
                know your nature
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Clan Curse</strong>: Pick a Clan Bane to suffer from as though you had Bane Severity 1; you may
                only
                take a Brujah or Gangrel Bane if you have the Bestial Temper Flaw, and may only take the Tremere Bane if
                you
                have the Catenating Blood Merit
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Dead Flesh</strong>: You suffer a -1 penalty to face-to-face Social tests with mortals, and
                medical
                examinations will reveal your body to be deceased; you cannot take this Flaw with the Likelife Merit
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Mortal Frailty</strong>: You cannot Rouse your Blood to heal, instead healing like a mortal; you
                cannot take this Flaw with the Vampiric Resilience Merit
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Shunned by Anarchs</strong>: You have somehow angered the Anarchs and now they would sooner
                throw
                you to the Camarilla than listen to your pleas; you cannot take this Flaw with the Anarch Comrades Merit
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Vitae Dependency</strong>: You cannot use Disciplines (including Thin-Blood Alchemy) unless you
                slake at least 1 Hunger each week by drinking another (non-Thin-Blood) vampire's blood; if you lose
                access
                to Disciplines this way, they return as soon as you slake at least 1 Hunger by drinking vampire blood
            </p>

            <h2>Backgrounds</h2>
            <h3>Allies</h3>
            <p>
                Allies are mortals who help and support you - family, friends, or an organisation that owes you some

            </p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <h4>Ally Reliability</h4>
            <p>
                (•) They are available roughly half the time you call upon them
                (••) When you call upon them, they are available in 1d10 hours
                (•••) When you call upon them, they appear as soon as possible
            </p>

            <h3>Enemies</h3>
            <p>
                Enemies are the opposite of Allies - mortals who appear at least once per story to oppose you. Write
                your Enemy or Enemies on the <strong>Relationship Map</strong>. Purchase Enemies as a Flaw with the
                following guidelines:

                (••) A deadly mortal, a gifted mortal with supernatural powers, or a well-armed group of gifted

            </p>

            <h3>Contacts</h3>
            <p>
                A Contact is a mortal with access to information or materials that would otherwise be difficult for you
                to acquire. Include your Contacts on the <strong>Relationship Map</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                (•) A Contact who can do or acquire something cheap or common (Resources 1) e.g. a drug dealer, gossip
                columnist, or used car salesman<br />
                (••) A Contact who can do or acquire something useful (Resources 2) e.g. veterinarian, small-time gun

            <h3>Fame</h3>
            <p>
                You may use your Fame to improve Social tests (normally instead of another Trait) when
                appropriate (<em>"don't you know I am?"</em>); this should make tests against your fans, tests for
                hunting, and so forth, easier. Fame has its downsides, of course, so you may want to invest in a
                disguise.
            </p>
            <p>
                By default, Fame applies to mortals, but you might instead be famous among vampires. Rare individuals
                might be famous among mortals <em>and</em> vampires.
            </p>
            <p>
                Fame normally counts as a Merit, but may be purchased as a Flaw by picking Infamy or Dark Secret.

                <strong>Merit</strong> (••••) Everyone who even vaguely cares about your field or social trends knows
                something about you

            <p>
                <strong>Flaw</strong> (••) You are a Cleaver, are known for several breaches of the Masquerade, have
                been Blood Hunted out of another city, or have grievously offended this domain's ruler
            </p>
            <h4>Infamy</h4>
            <p>
                Infamy is the Flaw version of Fame - you are well known for something horrible. At the very least,
                Social tests and reactions suffer by the value of the Flaw; at worst authorities may attempt to kill or
                capture you.
            </p>
            <p>
                The one-dot version of Infamy also includes the equivalent of a one-dot Dark Secret.
            </p>
            <h4>Dark Secret</h4>
            <p>
                This Flaw costs one dot less than the equivalent Infamy, as it is largely unknown.
            </p>

            <h3>Influence</h3>
            <p>
                Whether through wealth, prestige, political office, blackmail, or supernatural influence, you have pull
                with the local mortal community. Influence applies most within one group or region of a city (e.g.
                organised crime, the media, the police, the church, the South Side, Manhattan Island).
            </p>
            <p>
                You may use your Influence in place of another trait for relevant tests.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Merit: Dominant</strong> (•••••) Lesser figures try to figure out what you want and do it first

                do otherwise
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Merit: Entrenched</strong> (•••) Mortal factions and power-brokers hesitate to oppose you
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Merit: Influential</strong> (••) People want to do you favours

            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Flaw: Disliked</strong> (•) -1 to Social tests involving any group in the city except your
                Allies, Contacts, and other explicitly loyal supporters
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Flaw: Despised</strong> (••) -2 to convince a neutral actor to politically support you or do you
                a favour; one group or region in the city always attempts to thwart you and your associates
            </p>

            <h3>Haven</h3>
            <p>
                Without an appropriate Background such as Influence, Resources, or Status, a character's default Haven
                is likely to be something like a room in an abandoned motel, a rented office space, a single
                self-storage unit, or a small apartment with blacked-out windows.
            </p>
            <p>
                Points in Haven abstractly represent its size, security, and privacy; this increases the Difficulty
                third parties have finding, surveilling, or penetrating a Haven, and makes it easier for the resident
                vampire to notice danger whilst present.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Merit: Excellent Haven</strong> (•••) Very large, secure, or private (e.g. an out-of-town
                compound, bank building, or decommissioned subway station)
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Merit: Good Haven</strong> (••) Good size, security, or privacy (e.g. single-family home, row
                house, zoo enclosure, branch sewer tunnel)
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Merit: Modest Haven</strong> (•) Small, but more secure and private than default (e.g. basement
                apartment, crypt, locked warehouse storeroom)
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Flaw: No Haven</strong> (•) You must go to some effort (at least a basic test) to find a new
                resting place every morning
            </p>

                <strong>Flaw: Creepy</strong> (•) Social tests to put mortal guests at ease here suffer a -2 penalty,
                and neighbours may think it's the den of a serial killer or reclusive criminal (which it probably is)

            <p>
                <strong>Flaw: Haunted</strong> (•) Your Haven features a supernatural manifestation that you do not
                control - it may be a ghost, cursed object, or dimensional portal; it provides at least a -1 penalty to
