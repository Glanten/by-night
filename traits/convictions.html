            Incurring Stains on a character's Humanity, but doing so in the service of one of their Convictions, reduces
            the Stains by 1 or more

            Violating a Conviction may, at the Storyteller's discretion, incur 1 or more Stains depending on the
            violation's severity

            <h2>Touchstones</h2>
            <p>
                A Touchstone is a mortal NPC who embodies a Conviction; they may be someone your character knew in life,
                or
                someone they have come across since becoming a vampire
            </p>
            <p>
                Significantly benefiting one of your Touchstones, despite it being against your best interests, may
                remove
                Aggravated Willpower damage from your character
            </p>
            <p>
                Damaging or destroying a Touchstone incurs Stains on your character's Humanity
            </p>
