            Established vampires tend to pick up, and learn from, certain feeding habits.
        </p>

        <section>
            <h2>Alleycat</h2>
            <p>
                Stalking, overpowering, and feeding from whomever you can in an opportunistic manner. This is little
                more than mugging mortals for their blood.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Pick a Speciality: Intimidation (Stickups) <em>or</em> Brawl (Grappling)</li>

        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Bagger</h2>
            <p>
                You buy, steal, or otherwise procure cold, bagged blood. Ventrue may not pick this Predator Type.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Pick a Speciality: Larceny (Lockpicking) <em>or</em> Streetwise (Black Market)</li>

        <section>
            <h2>Blood Leech</h2>
            <p>
                You drink blood from other vampires, usually because you have a position of power, but sometimes through
                hunting or coercion. An extremely risky method of seeking the night's sustenance.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Pick a Speciality: Brawl (vampires) <em>or</em> Stealth (vampires)</li>
                <li>Gain 1 dot of Celerity <em>or</em> Protean</li>
                <li>Lose 1 dot of Humanity</li>

        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Cleaver</h2>
            <p>
                You covertly feed from your mortal family (or perhaps someone else's) and friends. Add the family to the
                <strong>Relationship Map</strong>. This almost always puts the Masquerade at risk.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Pick a Speciality: Persuasion (Gaslighting) <em>or</em> Subterfuge (Coverups)</li>

        <section>
            <h2>Consensualist</h2>
            <p>
                You always get permission before you feed; this might be by posing as a charity blood drive, performing
                in some sort of "alternative" club, or by explaining the truth to your victims. The last method is
                especially risky as it is a direct breach of the Masquerade.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Pick a Speciality: Medicine (Phlebotomy) <em>or</em> Persuasion (Victims)</li>

            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Farmer</h2>
            <p>
                You feed exclusively from animals. Hunger gnaws at you constantly. Ventrue, and vampires with Blood
                Potency 3 or higher, may not pick this Predator Type.

                You feed on those about to die from other causes, constantly on the lookout for new victims in hospices,
                care homes, and shelters.
            </p>
            <ul>
