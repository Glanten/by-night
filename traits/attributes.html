        <h2>Derived Attributes</h2>
        <p>
            Damage to Health or Willpower can be Superficial or Aggravated - most Superficial Damage is halved before it
            is applied to a character's tracker
        </p>

        <h3>Health</h3>
        <p>
            Typically harmed by injury and significant hardship; the lower it is, the closer you are to torpor and Final
            Death
        </p>
        <p>
            A character who fills their Health tracker with Superficial or Aggravated Damage is Impaired (-2 to Physical
            tests)
        </p>
        <p>
            Once a character's Health tracker is full of Aggravated Damage, they fall into torpor
        </p>
        <h4>Restoring Health</h4>
        <p>
            At the beginning of every session - mortals restore Health equal to their Stamina
        </p>
        <p>
            Vampires may restore Health by Rousing the Blood, their healing rate depends on their Blood Potency;
            Aggravated Damage is much harder to recover from, requiring three Rouse Checks per point restored, and
            limited to a maximum of 1 point per night
        </p>

        <h3>Willpower</h3>
        <p>
            Confidence and mental stability
        </p>
        <p>
            A character who fills their Willpower tracker with Superficial or Aggravated Damage is Impaired (-2 to
            Mental and Social tests)
        </p>
        <h4>Spending Willpower</h4>
        <p>
            Social Conflicts may reduce a character's Willpower, but it can also be spent in several beneficial ways:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Re-roll up to 3 dice (<em>not</em> Hunger Dice), except where the rules exclude the use of Willpower
                (e.g. rolling Humanity or a One-Roll Conflict)
            </li>
            <li>
                Take control of your character for one turn while they are under the effect of a Frenzy or supernatural
                effect
            </li>
            <li>
                Perform minute movements (twitch a finger, open eyelids) while staked
            </li>
            <li>
                Ignore Health damage penalties (e.g. Impairment) for one turn
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Restoring Willpower</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                At the beginning of every session - recover Superficial Willpower equal to the higher of your Compsure
                or Resolve (unless the last session ended on a cliffhanger, in the midst of an action scene, etc.)
            </li>
            <li>
                Once per session - recover 1 Superficial Willpower when you definitively act to further your Desire
            </li>
            <li>
                Recover 1 (or more) Superficial Willpower when you dramatically and convincingly play out a Messy
                Critical, Bestial Failure, Frenzy, or Compulsion (Storyteller's discretion)
            </li>
            <li>
                Recover 1 (or more) Aggravated Willpower when you act to significantly benefit one of your Touchstones,
                or uphold one of your Convictions against your best interests (Storyteller's discretion)
            </li>
            <li>
                At the end of a session - recover 1 Aggravated Willpower when you actively work toward your Ambition
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <strong>Humanity</strong>: How far your character has degenerated into monstrosity - a character with 0
            Humanity has completely succumbed to the Beast and can no longer be used as a playable character
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Hunger</strong>: Part appetite, part lust, and part addiciton - a vampire with Hunger 0 is sated and
            satisfied; a vampire with Hunger 5 is ravenous and can think of barely anything except their next meal
        </p>
