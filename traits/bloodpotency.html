            <h2>The Blush of Life</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Cost</strong>: 1 Rouse Check per night
            </p>
            <p>
                A vampire's body is functionally dead, signified by pale or ashen skin, cold flesh, lack of breath or
                heartbeat; the Blush of Life allows a vampire to recreate these lost characteristics and appear alive to
                all but the most intrusive medical screenings
            </p>
            <p>
                Thin-Bloods do not need to use the Blush of Life for their body to appear alive
            </p>
        </section>

            <h2>Blood Surge</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Cost</strong>: 1 Rouse Check
            </p>
            <p>
                Add bonus dice, depending on your Blood Potency, to an Attribute-based roll
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, if you have Dexterity 3 and your Blood Potency grants you 2 bonus dice, you can make a
                Rouse Check to treat your Dexterity as 5 for a single test
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Mending Damage</h2>
            <p>
                Superficial Damage to Health can be healed by making a Rouse Check (maximum once per turn)
            </p>
            <p>
                Aggravated Damage to Health can be healed by making three Rouse Checks (maximum 1 point per night); at
                the earliest, this can be done on the nightfall <em>after</em> the damage was received
            </p>
            <p>
                If healing Aggravated Damage would increase a vampire's Hunger to 5 or more, they fall into torpor
                rather than testing for Hunger Frenzy
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Discipline Bonus</h2>
            <p>
                Dice pools to use or resist Disciplines benefit from a bonus equal to half the vampire's Blood Potency
            </p>
            <p>
                Drinking blood with an Intense Temperament also grants 1 bonus dice to use or resist Disciplines with
                the appropriate Resonance
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Discipline Re-Roll</h2>
            <p>
                You may re-roll your Rouse Check to activate a Discipline if it is at the appropriate level, or below,
                depending on your Blood Potency - this essentially gives you a better chance of activating a given
                Discipline without increasing your character's Hunger
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Bane Severity</h2>
            <p>
                Each Clan has their own Bane, a drawback unique to members of that Clan that becomes more pronounced the
                greater the vampire's Blood Potency
            </p>
            <p>
                Direct sunlight also inflicts Aggravated Health Damage to a vampire equal to their Bane Severity every
                turn; Thin-Bloods take 1 point of Superficial Health Damage per turn instead
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Feeding Penalty</h2>
            <p>
                The more powerful a vampire becomes, the more restrictive their feeding becomes; blood from animals, or
                blood preserved in bags (without the use of medical anticoagulants etc.), cannot sustain older vampires
            </p>
            <p>
                A vampire's Hunger cannot be reduced to 0 without completely draining (and thereby killing) a human
                victim; older vampires find they must do this to reduce their Hunger below higher and higher values as
                they grow in power
            </p>
