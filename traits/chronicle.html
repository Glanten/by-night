            <h2>Tenets</h2>
            <p>
                Your Chronicle Tenets are moral and/or ethical guidelines; specifically, they are issues you want your
                characters to struggle with during the Chronicle. Chronicle Tenets apply to all characters in a
                Chronicle.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tenets should not be treated as Lines and Veils (i.e. things you want to avoid), Tenets are issues you
                <em>want</em> to invoke and work through in your game. Tenets are made to be broken in the pursuit of a
                good, dramatic story.
            </p>
            <p>
                When a character violates a Tenet, they incur 1 or more Stains on their Humanity. As Stains accumulate,
                the liklihood of your character being overwhelmed by their own actions or losing their Humanity
                increases.
            </p>
            <p>
                You should work with the Storyteller and your fellow players to come up with 3 Tenets for your
                Chronicle.

            <h2>Coterie: Domain</h2>
            <p>
                An established coterie is likely to have a Domain - territory in a city where they are permitted to
                hunt.
            </p>
            <p>
                Domains are measured with dots like other Traits, an abstraction of their strengths, weaknesses, and
                value. A Domain should be built from a party's coterie pool.
            </p>
            <p>
                A coterie without a Domain must poach from another's, or seek some sort of letter of passage from a
                position of authority - both courses of action carry their own risks.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Chasse</strong>: How well stocked, vulnerable, and rich the Domain is as a hunting ground; 1 dot
                makes it Difficulty 6 to hunt here, with each dot reducing that Difficulty by 1
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Lien</strong>: How connected the coterie is to its Domain; this modifies tests to find something
                or someone, get the word on the street, or investigate something in the area
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Portillon</strong>: How secure the Domain is from intrustion (e.g. from police or rival
                predators); each dot applies a penalty to an opponent's attempts to enter, investigate, or surveil the
                Domain without the coterie's knowledge (this only applies to the Domain itself, not Havens that might be
                within its borders)
            </p>

            <h2>Coterie: Backgrounds</h2>
            <p>
                You can pick Background Advantages and purchase them to apply to the entire coterie instead of a single
                character; while seemingly more economical, some Advantages (Contacts, Herds, Resources, etc.) may be
                stretched thin when abused by an entire coterie instead of an individual, and if a character ever leaves
                the coterie they also lose the benefits of the coterie's Advantages.
