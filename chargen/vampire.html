            <h3>Blood Potency</h3>
            <p>
                How strong is the unnatural power coursing through your veins? Your Blood Potency depends on your
                generation:
            </p>
            <div>
                <ul>
                    <li>10th or 11th Generation: Blood Potency 2</li>
                    <li>12th or 13th Generation: Blood Potency 1</li>
                    <li>14th or higher Generation: Blood Potency 0</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <p>
                Characters typically begin with Blood Potency 1. Only Thin-Blood characters have Blood Potency 0.

                How close are you to what you once were? How strong is the Beast's hold over you?
            </p>
            <p>
                Unless directed otherwise by your Storyteller, your initial Humanity should be 7.
