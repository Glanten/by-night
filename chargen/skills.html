    Some Skills have a <strong>Specialty</strong>. If you attempt a task that falls within a relevant Skill's
    Speciality, you gain an extra dice for the roll.
</div>
<div>
    If you put dots in Academics, Craft, Performance, and Science you get a free Speciality in that Skill.
</div>
<div>
    To assign your character's Skills, pick one of the methods below:
</div>

<h3>Method 1: Lifepath</h3>
<div>
    Develop your character's story by exploring the Skills they learned over the course of their life.
</div>

<h4>Professional Skills</h4>
<div>
    You gained these skills from your job, trade, profession, or primary pastime:
</div>
<div>
    One skill: (•••)<br />
    Two skills: (••)
</div>
<div>
    Choose a Speciality in one of your professional Skills (or pick an additional speciality if you receive a free
    speciality because of the skill's nature)
</div>

<h4>Life Event Skills</h4>
<div>
    What significant events led to you learning these Skills?
</div>
<div>
    One event taught you one skill: (•••)<br />
    Another event taught you one skill: (••)<br />
    Yet another event taught you a different skill: (••)
</div>

<h4>Leisure Skills</h4>
<div>
    Your time off and hobbies led to you learning the following:
</div>
<div>
    Three skills: (•)
</div>

<h4>Extra Skills</h4>
<div>
    Pick one of the following options:
</div>
<div>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Specialist: take one skill at (••••); you may change the Speciality in your Professional Skill to a
            Speciality in this Skill
        </li>
        <li>
            Generalist: take two skills at (••) and four skills at (•)
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    Ideally, come up with a plausible reason for developing these skills, but don't agonise over it for too long...
</div>

<h3>Method 2: Quick Skills</h3>

</div>

        </li>
    </ul>
