                Some Skills have a <strong>Specialty</strong>. If you attempt a task that falls within a relevant Skill's
                Speciality, you gain an extra dice for the roll.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you put dots in Academics, Craft, Performance, and Science you get a free Speciality in that Skill.

            <p>
                Develop your character's story by exploring the Skills they learned over the course of their life.
            </p>
            <h4>Professional Skills</h4>

            </p>
            <p>

                    <li>Another event taught you one skill: (••)</li>
                    <li>Yet another event taught you a different skill: (••)</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <h4>Leisure Skills</h4>
            <p>
                Your time off and hobbies led to you learning the following:
            </p>
            <p>
                Three skills: (•)
            </p>
            <h4>Extra Skills</h4>

            <div>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Specialist: take one skill at (••••); you may change the Speciality in your Professional Skill, above, to a Speciality in this Skill
