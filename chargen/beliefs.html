            <h3>Convictions</h3>
            <p>
                A Conviction is a guiding light for you to follow, a line you will not cross; a good Conviction
                typically starts with "<em>Always...</em>" or "<em>Never...</em>" and should be likely to come up in
                play
            </p>
            <p>
                Create between 1 and 3 Convictions for your character
            </p>
            <p>
                Did you adopt these Convictions from your family? Did you adopt them from a mentor or partner? Perhaps
                you developed them during one of your significant life events?
            </p>
            <h4>Example Convictions</h4>
            <div>
                <ul>
                    <li>"Always keep your sworn word"</li>
                    <li>"Never trust someone who earns more than you"</li>
                    <li>"Thou shalt not kill"</li>
                    <li>"Slavery is evil"</li>
                    <li>"I only care about me and mine"</li>
                    <li>"No meat without feet"</li>
                </ul>

            <h3>Touchstones</h3>
            <p>
                A Touchstone is a mortal who shines as an example of one of your Convictions
            </p>
            <p>
                Create one Touchstone for each of your Convictions
            </p>
            <p>
                Record your Touchstones on the <strong>Relationship Map</strong>

            <h3>Ambition</h3>
            <p>
                What was your life's greatest aspiration? This should be something grand, measurable, and achievable
            </p>
            <p>
                Note that your life's Ambition may change dramatically after your character becomes a vampire

            <h3>Desire</h3>
            <p>
                Your character's Desire represents a short-term goal; a good Desire is linked to someone on the
                <strong>Relationship Map</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                You may define your Desire at the beginning of every session; it is perfectly acceptable to pursue an
                unfulfilled Desire from a past session
