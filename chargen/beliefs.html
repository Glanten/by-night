<h2>Beliefs</h2>
<div>
    Think about your morals and ethics. What do you believe in? Who is important to you?
</div>

<h3>Convictions</h3>
<div>
    Create between 1 and 3 Convictions for your character.
</div>
<div>
    A Conviction is a guiding light for you to follow, a line you will not cross. A good Conviction typically starts
    with "<em>Always...</em>" or "<em>Never...</em>" and should be likely to come up in play.
</div>
<div>
    Did you adopt these Convictions from your family? Did you adopt them from a mentor or partner? Perhaps you developed
    them during one of your significant life events?
</div>

<h4>Example Convictions</h4>
<div>
    <ul>
        <li>"Always keep your sworn word"</li>
        <li>"Thou shalt not kill"</li>
        <li>"Never trust someone who earns more than you"</li>
        <li>"Slavery is evil"</li>
        <li>"I only care about me and mine"</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<h3>Touchstones</h3>
<div>
    A Touchstone is a mortal who shines as an example of one of your Convictions.
</div>
<div>
    Create a Touchstone character for each of your Convictions.
</div>
<div>
    Record your Touchstones on the <strong>Relationship Map</strong>.
</div>

<h3>Ambition</h3>
<div>
    What was your life's greatest aspiration? This should be something grand, measurable, and achievable.
</div>
<div>
    Note that your life's Ambition may change dramatically after the Embrace.
</div>

<h3>Desire</h3>
<div>
    Your character's Desire represents a short-term goal. A good Desire is linked to someone on the <strong>Relationship
        Map</strong>.
</div>
<div>
    You may define your Desire at the beginning of every session. It is perfectly acceptable to pursue an unfulfilled
    Desire from a past session.
