<h2>Relationship Map</h2>
<div>
    An important part of character creation is the <strong>Relationship Map</strong>, a social map that you create with
    your fellow players and the Storyteller to show the relationships between important characters in your Chronicle.
</div>

<h3>Establish Coterie Relationships</h3>
<div>
    Write the names of each member of the Coterie (i.e. the Player Characters) on the map.
</div>
<div>
    Give each member of the Coterie the following:
</div>
<div>
    <ul>
        <li>One positive relationship with someone else from the Coterie</li>
        <li>One negative relationship with someone else from the Coterie</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<h3>Sires</h3>
<div>
    You may come back to this step after picking your character's <a href="/clans.php">Clan</a>.
</div>
<div>
    Each member of the Coterie writes the name of their sire on the <strong>Relationship Map</strong> and draws an arrow
    from their sire to their character.
</div>
<div>
    You may wish to note your sire's Clan, the rough year of their Embrace, known Sect position, and the nature of your
    character's Embrace.
</div>

<h3>Supporting Sect Characters</h3>
<div>
    Each member of the Coterie should have connections with two more vampires; they may be someone else's sire, an
    existing support character, or one you create with the Storyteller.
</div>
<div>
    If your characters are new Fledlings, you may wish to skip this step.
