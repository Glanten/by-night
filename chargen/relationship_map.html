        An important part of character creation is the <strong>Relationship Map</strong>, a social map that you create
        with your fellow players and the Storyteller to show the relationships between important characters in your
        Chronicle.
    </p>

    <h3>Establish Coterie Relationships</h3>
    <p>
        Write the names of each member of the Coterie (i.e. the Player Characters) on the map.
    </p>
    <p>
        Give each member of the Coterie the following:
    </p>
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>One positive relationship with someone else from the Coterie</li>
        <li>One negative relationship with someone else from the Coterie</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Sires</h3>
    <p>
        You may come back to this step after picking your character's <a href="/clans.php">Clan</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Each member of the Coterie writes the name of their sire on the <strong>Relationship Map</strong> and draws
        an
        arrow
        from their sire to their character.
    </p>
    <p>
        You may wish to note your sire's Clan, the rough year of their Embrace, known Sect position, and the nature
        of
        your
        character's Embrace.
    </p>

    <h3>Supporting Sect Characters</h3>
    <p>
        Each member of the Coterie should have connections with two more vampires; they may be someone else's sire,
        an
        existing support character, or one you create with the Storyteller.
    </p>
    <p>
        If your characters are new Fledlings, you may wish to skip this step.
