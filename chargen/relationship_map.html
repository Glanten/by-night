            The <strong>Relationship Map</strong> is a social diagram connecting important characters in your Chronicle.
        </p>
        <p>
            You should work with the Storyteller and your fellow players to draw the Relationship Map during character
            creation.
        </p>

            <h3>Establish Coterie Relationships</h3>
            <p>
                Write the names of each member of the Coterie (i.e. the Player Characters) on the map.
            </p>
            <p>
                Give each member of the Coterie the following:
            </p>
            <p>
            <ul>
                <li>One positive relationship with someone else from the Coterie</li>
                <li>One negative relationship with someone else from the Coterie</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                A positive relationship might be something like <em>"fellow cat lover"</em>; a negative relationship
                might be something like <em>"doesn't trust rich kids"</em>
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Sires</h3>
            <p>
                You may come back to this step after picking your character's <a href="/clans.php">Clan</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each member of the Coterie writes the name of their sire on the <strong>Relationship Map</strong> and
                draws an arrow from their sire to their character.
            </p>
            <p>
                You may wish to note your sire's Clan, how long (roughly) they've been a vampire, known Sect position,
                and the nature of your character's fateful encounter with them.
            </p>

        <section>
            <h3>Supporting Sect Characters</h3>
            <p>
                If your characters are newly-turned Fledglings, you may wish to skip this step.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each member of the Coterie should have connections with two more vampires; they may be someone else's
                sire, an existing support character, or one you create with the Storyteller.
